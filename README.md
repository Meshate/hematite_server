# hematite_server [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PistonDevelopers/hematite.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PistonDevelopers/hematite)

This is the Hematite server, an implementation of the [Minecraft][] server in [Rust][]. Some of our goals are:

*   feature parity with the “Notchian” vanilla server,
*   increased performance,
*   and support for server mods written in Rust.

The Hematite server is currently in very early stages of development and completely unusable.
